## Description 

OOP game built with web technologies (html, css, javascript) and using DOM manipulation. It is a shooting game where you have a llama as a player, its spits as bullets, and CSS logos as targets. 
Functionalities: 
- Llama player that can move up and down the board
- Its spits are setup in a time interval
- The targets are also set up in a time interval where they can appear and dissapear three seconds later, anywhere in the screen  
- If the spits get the targets before they dissapear, then the user will have a counter on top to measure the amount of targets hit.

## How to play

- Move llama with arrow keys up and down to hit as many CSS logos as possible
- You can see the amount of spitted targets on the counter on top
- You can play until 3 targets are spitted 
- Play as many times as you want
