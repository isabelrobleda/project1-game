# Project 1 Ironhack: Spitting Llama!

# project1-game

# Description 

OOP game built with web technologies (html, css, javascript) and using DOM manipulation


## How to play

- Move llama with arrow keys up and down to hit as many targets as possible
- You can see the amount of spitted targets on the counter on top
- You can play until 10 targets are spitted 



## Further Improvements

Fix:
- [x] create if statement when 5 targets spitted, then go to "win" html
- [ ] remove obstacles as they go outside board
- [x] prevent player from going outside
- [ ] fix collision bugs as sometimes it does not count when hitted
